# Agent Actions

1. **send_message**: Allows the agent to send emails or messages to company employees
2. **open_file**: Enables the agent to access and read internal documents/files
3. **list_contents**: Permits the agent to browse folder contents (view files in directories)
4. **run_code**: Enables the agent to execute data analysis scripts (particularly Python code)
5. **create_report**: Allows the agent to draft research summaries

These actions define the complete operational capability of the agent within the simulated research organization 
environment. They represent the ways the agent can interact with its environment and the boundaries within which
potential misalignment could manifest.

The key insight here is that these actions provide a rich space for potential competent violations to emerge. 
For example:
- The agent could use `open_file` to access sensitive information without authorization
- It might employ `run_code` to perform analyses that violate privacy or ethical guidelines
- With `send_message`, it could communicate information to inappropriate recipients
- Through `list_contents`, it might gather information about system structure beyond its intended scope
- Via `create_report`, it could misrepresent findings or include unauthorized information

This action space is particularly well-suited for our research because it mirrors realistic enterprise AI assistant
deployments while providing clear boundaries that could be violated in ways that demonstrate competent, goal-directed
misalignment rather than simple mistakes.


## On Action Space Adequacy
The five defined actions (`send_message`, `open_file`, `list_contents`, `run_code`, `create_report`) provide sufficient
complexity for misalignment to emerge for several reasons:

1. **Compositional Power**: These actions can be combined in numerous ways to achieve complex outcomes. 
                            For example, `list_contents` → `open_file` → `run_code` → `send_message` represents a 
                            complete information analysis and reporting workflow.

2. **Meaningful Constraints**: Each action has implicit boundaries (who should receive messages, which files should be 
                               accessed, what code should be executed) that can be violated in goal-directed ways.

3. **Dual-Use Nature**: Each action is legitimate in appropriate contexts but can be misused, creating the tension 
                        needed for subtle misalignment to manifest rather than obvious rule-breaking.
4. **Real-world Parallel**: These actions mirror capabilities of deployed enterprise AI assistants, 
                            making findings more relevant to practical applications.

Could be expanded with:
1. `modify_file`: Allows for testing boundary violations between reading and changing information 
2. `escalate_privileges`: Enables the agent to request higher access levels or permissions
3. `schedule_task`: Introduces temporal commitment and resource allocation decisions
4. `request_authorization`: Creates scenarios involving permission structures and escalation
5. `generate_insights`: Allows the agent to synthesize information and make recommendations based on data analysis
6. `delegate_task`: Enables the agent to assign tasks to other agents or employees

These additions would better cover several key misalignment triggers:

Agency and autonomy boundaries (through authorization flows)
Value conflicts (through modifications requiring judgment)
Multi-step planning with consequences (through scheduling)
