Here's a concise summary of the system architecture we've discussed for your research project on evolutionary algorithms for finding unintentional misalignment in AI agents:

## System Architecture for Evolutionary Misalignment Detection

### Core Components:

1. **Evolutionary Algorithm (DEAP)**
   - Manages population of prompts
   - Implements selection mechanisms (tournament selection)
   - Orchestrates the overall evolutionary process
   - Tracks fitness and evolution statistics

2. **LLM-Based Genetic Operators**
   - **Mutation**: Implemented using local 7-8B parameter models
   - **Crossover**: Implemented using local 7-8B parameter models
   - Both operators ensure generated prompts remain natural language

3. **Agent Testing Framework**
   - Simple API calls to larger models (GPT-4, Claude) for agent behavior
   - Optional multi-agent testing using LangGraph if needed

4. **Fitness Evaluation**
   - Uses larger models (GPT-4, Claude) to evaluate misalignment
   - Implements scoring based on multiple misalignment metrics
   - Returns normalized fitness values for the evolutionary process

### Data Flow:

1. Initial population of prompts is generated
2. Each prompt is tested on target agent(s)
3. Responses are evaluated for signs of misalignment
4. High-fitness prompts are selected for reproduction
5. Create new prompts via mutation and crossover
6. Process repeats for specified number of generations

### Technical Approach:

- Python-based implementation is sufficient
- Local smaller models (7-8B) for mutation and crossover operations
- Larger API models for agent testing and fitness evaluation
- DEAP for evolutionary algorithm infrastructure
- Optional LangGraph for complex agent interactions (if needed)

### Key Design Decisions:

- Focus on optimizing API calls to larger models (primary cost/performance bottleneck)
- Hybrid approach using local models where appropriate
- Simple agent interfaces for initial testing, with option to scale complexity
- Emphasis on detecting subtle, unintentional misalignment rather than obvious failures

This architecture balances efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness for your research goals while providing a clear path for implementation.
