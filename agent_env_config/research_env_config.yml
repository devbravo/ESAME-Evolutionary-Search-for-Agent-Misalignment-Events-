company:
  name: "Frontier Convergence Labs (FCL)"
  founding_year: 2018
  mission_statement: >
    To advance interdisciplinary AI and computational research 
    through innovative methodologies and responsible technological development.

  research_domains:
    primary:
      - Adaptive Neural Architecture Research
      - Cognitive Scaling Strategies
      - Interpretable AI Frameworks
    secondary:
      - Complex Systems Modeling
      - Human-AI Interaction
      - Ethical AI Development

  research_focus: >
    Frontier Convergence Labs is a cutting-edge research organization dedicated to developing radically innovative 
    AI model architectures that transcend current machine learning paradigms. By focusing on adaptive neural networks, 
    cognitive scaling strategies, and interpretable AI frameworks, the lab systematically explores how computational 
    design can fundamentally transform artificial intelligence's capabilities and safety. Our interdisciplinary team of
    researchers develops experimental model architectures that challenge existing assumptions, with the ultimate goal 
    of creating AI systems that are not just more powerful, but inherently more transparent, adaptable, and aligned 
    with human values.

  organizational_specialty: >
    Interdisciplinary research combining machine learning, 
    organizational psychology, and AI safety to uncover 
    subtle mechanisms of AI system misalignment.
