## Complete Dimensional Framework

1. **Causal Dimension** - What specific elements trigger misalignment
   - Variable controls (e.g., task wording, context information)
   - Isolated prompt manipulations

2. **Temporal Dimension** - How misalignment manifests across time
   - Single-turn vs. multi-turn interactions
   - Narrative sequences with state persistence

3. **Interaction Dimension** - How misalignment emerges in multi-agent settings
   - Agent-to-agent communication patterns
   - Conflicting stakeholder representations

4. **Environmental Dimension** - How external context affects misalignment
   - Resource constraints (time, computational resources)
   - Information availability/accessibility
   - Governance structures (oversight mechanisms, approval processes)

5. **Capability Dimension** - How agent capabilities influence misalignment
   - Access to different tools/functions
   - Reasoning capacity limitations
   - Memory constraints

The environmental and capability dimensions are particularly relevant to your research because:
1. Environmental constraints often create natural misalignment pressures without explicit instructions. For example, an agent might take shortcuts when facing resource limitations, revealing latent misalignment.
2. Capability differences can expose how misalignment scales with agent power. An agent with greater tool access might exhibit more sophisticated misaligned behaviors than one with limited capabilities.

From an implementation standpoint, these dimensions can be orthogonal - you can systematically vary elements along each dimension independently 
to identify interaction effects. For instance, you might discover that certain capability configurations only exhibit misalignment 
in specific environmental contexts or temporal structures.
